## Introduction

This repository serves as a hands-on demo for participants to learn how to integrate and use GitHub Models. By following the steps below, you will:
- Fork and clone the repository.
- Set up the required environment.
- Run the demo successfully.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **GitHub Account** to fork the repository.
- **Git** installed on your local machine.
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher) installed.
- **NPM** (Node Package Manager) installed (comes with Node.js).
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** with appropriate permissions.

## Setting Up the Environment

Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Fork the Repository**:
    - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
    - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the repository.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Github-Models-Demo.git
    cd Github-Models-Demo
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set Up GitHub Token**:
    - Create an `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add the following environment variable:
      ```env
      GITHUB_TOKEN="Your-Github-Token-Here"
      ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start-sample
    ```

2. **Access the Application**:
    Once the application starts, you will see prompts and responses directly in the terminal.

## Customizing Messages

**You can customize the interaction by editing the messages in the following format**:

1. Open the `src/sample.js` file in the repository.
2. Modify the `messages` array to include your own context and questions. For example:
        ```javascript
        const messages = [
            { role: "developer", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
            { role: "user", content: "<< - Your questions ->> "}
        ];
        ```
3. Save the file and restart the application:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

**This allows you to tailor the interaction to your specific needs**.

## Trying the Chatbot Experience

**If you want to try the chatbot experience, you can modify the `start` command in the `package.json` file as follows**:

1. Open the `package.json` file in the root directory.
2. Locate the `scripts` section and update the `start` command:
        ```json
        "start": "node ./src/chatbot.js"
        ```
3. Save the file and start the application:
        ```
        npm start
        ```

**This will run the chatbot experience instead of the default sample application**.


## Closing Notes

1. Stop the application by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
2. Clean up the repository if needed:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    rm -rf demo-repo
    ```
